# DataVisualizationUsingMatplotLib
Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.
Created this on 2019 November, used three datasets here, created bar graphs, box plots, pie charts, histograms, line plots, scatter plots using matplotlib.
